				<p align="justify">There is a huge push for smart cities in India under the Smart Cities Mission, which is a new
					initiative by the Government of India to drive economic growth and improve the quality of life of people by
					enabling local development and harnessing technology to create smart outcomes for citizens. In this ambitious
					project, 100 cities are being covered for the duration of 5 years with budget of Rs.100 crore per city per
					year. As shown in the figure, the mission focuses on 24 main elements on transformation.</p>
				<p align="justify">Leveraging the core and domain strengths, IIIT-H had established a Center of Excellence on
					IoT for Smart Cities in Jan 2019 with support from India-EU project. IIIT-H together with EBTC and with
					possible support from other knowledge partners like LAAS-CNRS as well as Bordeaux Metropole proposed to take
					this living lab initiative to the next level with support from Ministry of Electronics and Information
					Technology (MEITY) and the State Government of Telangana, who have already shown interest. The IIIT
					(International Institute of Information Technology) Campus in Hyderabad will apply their smart city approach
					to make a Living Lab in the campus to create an urban area enhancing three value domains: social, economic and
					environmental. This will lead to a Livable and renewable area that will be a new urban centre in Hyderabad.
