                   <li>Collaborate is about organizing an ecosystem with partners like government, corporates, research institutes, SMEâ€™s, scaleups etc. Due to the size and complexity of the addressed themes, we need many parties to collaborate. Together with partners, we reach out to solution providers to make joint impact, better and faster.</li>
                   <li>Accelerate is about finding the solutions and accelerating the selection of the right solutions. Reaching out to solution providers with (more) market-ready solutions instead of merely setting up new initiatives, accelerates the living lab goals effectively.</li>
                   <li>Innovate is about the process and facilities needed to bring innovation to execution. We combine the expertise and resources from our partners and what we have in place at the IIIT campus.</li>
