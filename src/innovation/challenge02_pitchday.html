Aligning to the Indian Government's goal to create 100 smart cities, we bring the private and public sector together with research facilities to work on the challenges of smart cities. Our vision to support and scale startups that are building sustainable, inclusive and innovative solutions for smart cities. It is a 1 month-long program that gives selected startups an opportunity to pitch to the leaders in the smart city ecosystem and to win an equity-free grant of 10 Lakhs for further development.We received an overwhelming response of 150+ applications from innovative smart city startups across the Water, Waste Management, Health, Energy, Safety and Security sectors in May and June. The first screening for these startups was done by an internal panel, where 70 startups were selected. These startups will be listed in the startup innovation registry. From the 70 startups, we selected 14 startups for the final pitch day, and these startups presented their product/solutions to a panel of esteemed smart city leaders.

The final winners were declared and they are <br><b> MinionLabs and Vacus Tech Pvt Ltd </b></br>

              <p>We have developed an intelligent floating agriculture cum waterbody management system. The idea is to
                grow vegetables, flowers, on the surface of water and harvest fish on the water body. In tier I- tier II
                cities the device will help maintain the health of the water body by reducing siltation due to anaerobic
                conditions and increase ground water table reducing the temperature by 5 degrees and reduce the breed of
                mosquitos and insects in housing society ponds.</p>
